File Structure:

Resources - holds all of the internal resources for your project that you've created. This includes stylesheets (vanilla CSS you've created), js, images (png, gif, jpeg), and data (json, csv, xml, text).

Vendors - this folder contains external libraries that you are using inside of your project. (Examples: jQuery, css libraries, jQuery plug-ins, etc.)

** Images used by your stylesheets should be placed in an 'css > images' folder. **
